# Week 1 Assignment: Intro to Node.js & Async JavaScript

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what Node.js is and how it differs from browser JavaScript
- Explore Node.js architecture and the V8 engine
- Use Node.js global objects (`global`, `process`, `__dirname`)
- Identify key use cases for Node.js (APIs, CLIs, real-time apps)
- Understand module systems (CommonJS vs ES Modules)
- Grasp asynchronous JavaScript concepts: blocking vs non-blocking I/O, the event loop, callbacks, promises, async/await
- Work with Node core modules: `fs`, `path`, `os`
- Use file system methods (`fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`, `fs.promises`), and understand why streams matter for large files

## Assignment Guidelines

1. **Setup**
   - You should have already done 'Getting Started' instructions, which sets up your Node-Homework Directory.
   - Work inside the `assignment1` folder for all your answers and code for this assignment.
   - **ESM Module Setup**: Since we're using ESM modules in this course, make sure your `package.json` file includes `"type": "module"`. Alternatively, you can use `.mjs` file extensions for your JavaScript files. The recommended approach is to set `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.
2. **Create a branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your work on assignment 1 (e.g., `assignment1`).
   - Make all your changes and commits on this branch.
4. **Before you test:**
   - Please read the TDD Testing Guide for how to run and interpret the course-provided tests: [TDD Testing Guide](?page=test-driven-development-(tdd)-testing-guide)
   - Watch this video that goes over Test Driven Development: [How to Read Tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxe1yNSC6H4)
3. **Run the tests:**
   - After completing the tasks, run the tests using:
     ```bash
     npm run tdd assignment1
     ```
   - Make sure all tests pass before submitting your work.

## Assignment Tasks

**Setup Note:** Before starting, make sure you have a  `sample-files` directory in your `assignment1` folder. This directory will be used for file operations in tasks 3 and 4.

**Important:** Follow the exact formatting requirements specified in each task. The automated tests expect specific console output formats, so pay attention to spacing, capitalization, and punctuation in your console.log statements.

### 1. Node.js Fundamentals
- In a markdown file (`node-fundamentals.md`), answer the following:
  - What is Node.js?
  - How does Node.js differ from running JavaScript in the browser?
  - What is the V8 engine, and how does Node use it?
  - What are some key use cases for Node.js?
  - Explain the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules. Give a code example of each. (Note: We use ESM in this course.)

### 2. Exploring Node Globals
- Create a script (`globals-demo.js`) that logs the following with **exact formatting**:
  - Since we're using ESM modules, you'll need to create `__dirname` and `__filename` equivalents. Use `import.meta.url` with `fileURLToPath` from the `url` module and `dirname` from the `path` module to create these.
  - `console.log('__dirname:', __dirname);`
  - `console.log('__filename:', __filename);`
  - `console.log('Process ID:', process.pid);` 
  - `console.log('Platform:', process.platform);` 
  - A custom global variable: `global.myCustomVar = 'Hello, global!';` followed by `console.log('Custom global variable:', global.myCustomVar);`

**Important:** Use exactly one space after the colon in each console.log statement, and use the exact capitalization shown above for "Process ID" and "Platform". Remember to use ESM import syntax.

### 3. Asynchronous JavaScript
- Create a script (`async-demo.js`) that:
  - Reads a file asynchronously using `fs.readFile` (or `fs.promises.readFile` for promise-based approach)
  - Demonstrates a callback function and explains callback hell with a code example (in comments)
  - Converts the callback code to use Promises, then async/await
  - Uses `try/catch` for error handling
  - **Important:** For each async pattern (callback, promise, async/await), your console output should include the phrase `Hello, async world!` to match the file content and test expectations.
  - **File Setup:** In your `sample-files` directory, create a `sample.txt` file containing exactly "Hello, async world!" (without quotes) for the async demo to read.
  - **Note:** Use ESM import syntax (e.g., `import fs from 'fs'` or `import fs from 'fs/promises'`).

**Console Output Examples:**
When you run your async-demo.js, you should see output like:
```
Callback read: Hello, async world!
Promise read: Hello, async world!
Async/Await read: Hello, async world!
```


### 4. Node Core Modules
- Create a script (`core-modules-demo.js`) that:
  - Uses the `os` module to log system information (platform, CPU, memory)
  - Uses the `path` module to join two paths and log the result
  - Uses the `fs.promises` API to write and then read a file (`demo.txt`)
  - Creates a file called `largefile.txt` in your `sample-files` folder. You can do this by writing a loop that writes many lines to the file (e.g., 100 lines of any text). Demonstrate reading `largefile.txt` using a readable stream (`fs.createReadStream`). For each chunk read, log the first 40 characters (or any summary) to the console. When the stream ends, log a message like "Finished reading large file with streams." Use the `highWaterMark` option in `fs.createReadStream` to control the chunk size (e.g., set it to 1024 for 1KB chunks). You can experiment with different values to see how it affects the number of chunks and the output.
  - **Note:** Use ESM import syntax (e.g., `import os from 'os'`, `import path from 'path'`, `import fs from 'fs'`).

**Console Output Examples:**
When you run your core-modules-demo.js, you should see output like:
```
Platform: darwin
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz
Total Memory: 17179869184
Joined path: /path/to/sample-files/folder/file.txt
fs.promises read: Hello from fs.promises!
Read chunk: This is a line in a large file...
Finished reading large file with streams.
```

## Testing Your Work

After completing each script, run it to make sure it produces the expected output:

```bash
node globals-demo.js
node async-demo.js  
node core-modules-demo.js
```

The automated tests will check that your output matches the expected format. If a test fails, check that your console.log statements use the exact spacing and capitalization shown in the examples above.
