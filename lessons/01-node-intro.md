## **1.1 What is Node**

The JavaScript language was created to run inside the browser, so as to create rich and responsive web applications.  It is an interpreted language that is platform independent, running on Mac, Linux, Windows, and other platforms. The code you run in the browser is loaded from the Internet and can't be trusted, so there are things that JavaScript isn't allowed to do when running in the browser, like accessing the local file system or opening a server side socket. To provide security protections, browser side JavaScript runs in a sandbox, a protected area that blocks off various functions.

A while back, some folks at Google had the thought: There are a lot of JavaScript programmers.  Wouldn't it be nice if they could write server side code in JavaScript?  At the time, the other leading platform independent language was Java, a far more complicated language.

So, they created a version of JavaScript that runs locally on any machine, instead of in the browser. They created Node, short for Node.js.  This version of JavaScript has no sandbox. In Node, you can do anything that one could do in other programming languages, subject only to the security protections provided by the operating system.

**The V8 Engine**: Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that powers Google Chrome. V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine written in C++ that compiles JavaScript code to native machine code for fast execution. When you run JavaScript in Node.js, V8:
- Parses your JavaScript code
- Compiles it to optimized machine code
- Executes it efficiently
- Manages memory (garbage collection)

This is why Node.js can execute JavaScript so quickly—it's not interpreting the code line by line, but rather compiling it to native code that runs directly on your machine's processor. The V8 engine is what makes Node.js fast and efficient, allowing it to compete with other server-side technologies.

But, there was a problem. JavaScript is single threaded. So, if code for a web application server were doing an operation that takes time: file system access, reading stuff from a network connection, accessing a database, and so on, all the web requests would have to wait.  The solution is the event loop.  If a "slow" operation is to be performed, the code makes the request, but does not wait for it to complete. Instead, it provides a callback to be called when the operation does complete, and continues on to do other stuff that doesn't depend on the outcome of the request.  There is a good video that gives the details here: [What the heck is the event loop?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ).  That video may give more information than you want or need now, but check it out at your leisure.  The stuff is good to know.  When you call an asynchronous API in the event loop, you are calling into an environment that is written in C++, and that environment is multithreaded. Your request is picked up from the queue and handed off to a thread. That thread performs the work—perhaps blocking for a time—before eventually issuing the callback. The event loop is present in both browser-based JavaScript and Node.js runtimes, but the Node version generally has more capabilities.

Because of this approach, web application servers written in JavaScript are faster than those written in Python or Ruby. Those languages don't do as much in native code, at least for asynchronous operations, so web application servers in these languages have to be multithreaded, at a significant performance cost.  Web application servers in Node are pretty fast, though not quite as fast as those in C++ or Rust.  Java is also faster than Node in some scenarios, such as those where multiprocessing can be leveraged to advantage.  There are still some kinds of functions for which JavaScript is not a good choice, such as intensive numeric calculations.

Here is a basic video summary of node capabilities: [What is Node.js?](https://youtu.be/uVwtVBpw7RQ)

## **1.2 Asynchronous Programming**

### **The Call Stack**

Computer code is merely a sequence of instruction steps. The sequence of instructions utilized in Node.js is referred to as the **call stack**.

A stack is a data structure like a stack of pancakes. Instructions are put on the stack and then run from the most recent (top) and down to the bottom of the stack. This is called **Last In First Out (LIFO)** order.

Node cannot run multiple instructions simultaneously; however, there is a clever workaround. For any task that cannot be completed immediately, it can be moved off the stack to the event loop.

### **The Event Loop**

The event loop is a holding area for instructions that are pending. When a pending instruction is ready to be processed, it is put into a queue.

A queue is a data structure just like the waiting line that forms when you go to the bank. The sequence of a queue is **First In First Out (FIFO)**.

In Node, when the call stack finishes all of its operations, it then begins processing instructions from the queues in the event loop.

### **Non-Blocking Operations**

Even though Node can only run one instruction at a time, the event loop prevents pending operations from blocking the program. The event loop allows many instructions to be performed asynchronously.

**Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O**: Understanding the difference between blocking and non-blocking operations is crucial:

- **Blocking I/O**: When an operation blocks, it means the program stops and waits for that operation to complete before continuing. For example, if you read a file synchronously, your program cannot do anything else until the file is completely read. This is inefficient because the program is idle while waiting.

- **Non-Blocking I/O**: With non-blocking operations, your program initiates an operation and continues executing other code. When the operation completes, a callback (or promise) is triggered. This allows Node.js to handle many operations concurrently, even though JavaScript itself is single-threaded.

Node.js uses non-blocking I/O by default for most operations. This is why Node.js can handle many concurrent connections efficiently—while waiting for one file to be read or one database query to complete, it can process other requests.

This makes the Node environment more performant for some things than would be possible in Python or Ruby, which don't handle asynchronous operations as efficiently.

## **1.3 Running Node**

### **What is Node?**

Node is an application just like other applications you are familiar with. Photoshop edits photos, browsers browse websites, Node.js runs JavaScript.

A difference is that Node does not have a graphical user interface. Therefore, to utilize it directly you must use the command line.

At your terminal, type `Node`. (You should have completed the setup assignment. If this command doesn't do anything, go back and do the setup.) This starts the environment, and you can enter and run JavaScript statements.

### **Node.js Environment**

We have established that Node.js runs JavaScript on your machine outside the browser. In other words, it is a JavaScript runtime environment.

In your terminal in the Node environment, try a `console.log()`. You may notice one difference from the browser environment. Where does the output appear? It appears in your terminal. Obvious, right?

However, if you open up the console in your browser developer tools, you will not see the output for Node `console.log()` statements. We have had some folks fresh from the React class who develop a Node/Express application, put `console.log()` debugging statements in, and go to the browser console to see them.

### **Node.js vs The Browser**

The browser and Node are environments with notable differences:

**Browser:**
- Mostly interacts with the DOM or Web Platform APIs (i.e., Cookies)
- The document, window, and other objects provided by the browser
- All of these do not exist in Node

**Node.js:**
- APIs via modules (i.e., filesystem)
- Those do not exist in browser

With Node.js you control the environment, not Chrome, not Firefox, not Edge. For example, you decide which version of Node to use and other variables of the environment.

There are also some small differences in JavaScript syntax when using Node, as we'll learn.

### **Running Your First Node Program**

You should have set up your `node-homework` repository and folder. In the terminal, cd to that folder and start VSCode. Create a first.js file in the assignment1 directory, with a `console.log()` statement in it. Start a VSCode terminal, and type "node ./assignment1/first". This is how you tell Node to start a program you write. You do not have to give the `.js` extension. Ok, so much for the very simple stuff.

## **1.4 Syntax Differences between Node and Browser Based JavaScript**

There are a couple of syntax differences in Node.  Browser side JavaScript follows the ESM standard for importing and exporting functions and objects to/from other modules.  In browser side JavaScript, you load other modules as follows:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

Node also supports ESM syntax.  In Node, you can do an equivalent like:

```js
import { register, logoff } from "../controllers/userController.js";
```

In ESM JavaScript, you typically do named exports, like:

```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b
}
```

Or, alternately, you could do a default export, as follows:

```js
export default { add, multiply }
```

**We will use ESM in this course.**  To use ESM in Node.js, you need to either:
1. Use files with extension `.mjs`, or
2. Set `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file

## **1.5 Other Important Differences between Node and Browser JavaScript**

In browser side JavaScript, you always have access to the window and document objects, and through them, you have access to the DOM.  For Node, there is no window, no document, and no DOM.

What you have instead in Node is a global object. This includes the following attributes and functions:

- process: Contains information about the currently running process, including all environment variables, which are stored as key-value pairs in `process.env`. Additionally, `process.argv` contains the command-line arguments passed when the Node program was started. Specifically, `process.argv[0]` is the fully qualified filename of the Node executable itself, and `process.argv[1]` is the fully qualified name of the JavaScript file being executed. Any further arguments passed on the command line appear as subsequent entries in the `process.argv` array.
- console: console.log() is available, just as it is in client side JavaScript.
- import.meta.url: In ESM modules, this provides the URL of the current module. You can use this with the `fileURLToPath` function from the `url` module to get the equivalent of `__filename` in ESM.
- import.meta.dirname: In newer Node.js versions (20.11.0+), this provides the directory where the current module resides. For older versions, you can derive it from `import.meta.url`.

Note: In ESM modules, `__dirname` and `__filename` are not available by default. If you need them, you can create them like this:

```js
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { dirname } from 'path';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);
```

For importing modules in ESM, you use `import` statements instead of `require()`. If a module calls `import http from "http"`, it is loading the built-in Node.js module called http. If the module name isn't built-in, Node.js will then look for it in the installed npm packages. If a module calls `import parser from "../utils/parser.js"`, it is loading the `../utils/parser.js` module, where the pathname is relative to the current module. Note that in ESM, you must include the file extension (`.js`) in relative imports.

The variables you declare inside of a node module are available only within that module, unless you export them, or unless you attach them to the global object, like:

```js
global.userName = "Joan";
```

The latter is usually a bad practice.  Don't export non-constant values from a module.  If these values change, the modules that access them via import won't get the new values.  On the other hand, if you export a constant object, any module with access can mutate that object, and all other modules do see the new values within the object.  The same is true if you export a constant array.

On the Node side: You also have file system access, process information and control, local operating system services, and networking APIs.  The last is important.  You can open a web server socket in Node.  You can't do these things in browser-side JavaScript because they are forbidden by the browser's sandbox protections and because the APIs don't exist there. In Node.js, you have the additional capabilities of starting programs with command-line arguments and reading input from or writing output to a terminal session.  There are an extensive series of publicly available libraries for Node, such as Express, and many others you will use in this class.  For example, there is NodeGui, which allows you to write native graphical user interfaces without any involvement of a browser -- but we won't use that one in this class.

Because Node runs on a server, and not on the browser, you can safely store secrets.  It is quite possible to do database access from a browser front end, but you'd rarely want to do this.  To access a database you need a credential.  There is no place to securely store a credential on a browser front end. The same applies to any network service protected by a credential.  Node processes can access them securely, but JavaScript in the browser can't.

Node provides a REPL, which stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop.  It is just a terminal session with Node, into which you can type JavaScript statements, and they'll execute.  You start it by just typing `Node`.

You have used npm to do package management for your React project.  We will also use npm to do package management for your Node project.

## **1.6 Node.js Documentation and Libraries**

Node.js provides extensive online documentation that is essential for developers. The primary resource is the official Node.js API documentation available at [https://nodejs.org/api/](https://nodejs.org/api/). This site contains comprehensive guides, reference materials, and examples for all built-in modules and APIs.

### **Navigating the Online Documentation**

The Node.js documentation is organized by module, with each page detailing the functions, classes, and methods available. Key sections include:

- **Stability Index**: Each API is marked with a stability index (0-3) indicating its maturity level. Avoid using APIs marked as experimental (0) in production code.
- **Examples**: Most documentation pages include practical code examples showing how to use the APIs.
- **Version Information**: Documentation specifies which Node.js version introduced or deprecated certain features.
- **Search Functionality**: Use the search bar to quickly find specific functions or modules.

When learning Node.js, bookmark the API docs and refer to them frequently. The documentation is your primary reference for understanding available tools and best practices.

### **Standard Node.js Libraries**

Node.js comes with a rich set of built-in modules that provide core functionality without requiring installation. These modules cover file system operations, networking, operating system interactions, and more. To use any built-in module, you simply `import` it in your code:

```js
import fs from 'fs';  // File system operations
import os from 'os';  // Operating system information
import net from 'net'; // Networking (TCP sockets)
import http from 'http'; // HTTP server and client
import https from 'https'; // HTTPS server and client
```

Unlike browser JavaScript, which is limited by security sandboxes, Node.js allows direct access to these system-level capabilities. Built-in modules are always available and don't require `npm install`.

### **NPM Libraries**

Beyond the built-in modules, Node.js has access to thousands of third-party libraries through the Node Package Manager (NPM). These libraries extend Node.js functionality for tasks like database connections, authentication, testing, and more.

#### **Finding and Installing NPM Packages**

To find packages, visit [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/) and search for your needs. Once you find a suitable package, install it using:

```bash
npm install package-name
```

Then import it in your code:

```js
import packageName from 'package-name';
```

#### **Evaluating Package Quality**

When choosing an NPM package, consider these indicators of quality and reliability:

- **Download Count**: Higher downloads suggest wider adoption and testing.
- **GitHub Stars**: More stars indicate community approval.
- **Last Updated**: Recent updates show active maintenance.
- **Issues and Pull Requests**: A healthy ratio of open/closed issues suggests good support.
- **Dependencies**: Fewer dependencies reduce complexity and potential security risks.
- **License**: Ensure the license is compatible with your project.
- **Documentation**: Well-documented packages are easier to use and troubleshoot.
- **Maintainer Activity**: Check if maintainers are responsive to issues.

Popular, well-maintained packages like Express.js, Lodash, and Axios are good examples of reliable NPM libraries. Always check for security vulnerabilities using `npm audit` after installation.

## **1.7 File System Access with Async Operations**

As we've said, Node lets you access the file system.  The functions you use are documented here: [https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html).  You will see some synchronous file access functions.  You could, for example, do:

```js
const fileHandle = fs.openSync("./tmp/file.txt", "w");
```

You might call such functions if you are doing some scripting on the server.  But you would never do this in a web application.  While the synchronous call is occurring, not only would the originator of the HTTP request have to wait, all requests coming to your application server would have to wait, which is not acceptable.

The base functions of the file system package require callbacks:

```js
import fs from "fs";

fs.open("./tmp/file.txt", "w", (err, fileHandle) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log("file open failed: ", err.message);
  } else {
    console.log("file open succeeded.  The file handle is: ", fileHandle);
  }
});
console.log("last statement");
```

What order do you think the logged lines will appear when you run this program?  The answer is that you will see "last statement" printed first, followed by "file open succeeded."  The asynchronous fs.open() call just tells the Node event loop to do the open and continues on to output "last statement".  Then the event loop completes the file open and does the callback.  And then you see the other message.

Now, clearly, if you were to write a line to this file, you'd have to do it in the callback, so that you have access to the file handle.  That call would also be asynchronous, with a callback.  If you want to write a second line, you'd have to do that write in the second callback.  And so on, to "callback hell".  You could keep your file legible through clever use of recursion, but it's still messy.  Now, as you know, we have promises in JavaScript.  So, one choice would be to wrap the async call in a promise, as follows:

```js
import fs from "fs";

const doFileOperations = async () => {
  // we need this separate function because you can't do an await 
  // statement in mainline JavaScript code
  try {
    const filehandle = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      fs.open("./tmp/file.txt", "w", (err, filehandle) => {
        return err ? reject(err) : resolve(filehandle);
      });
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("An error occurred.", err);
  }
};

doFileOperations(); // You can't put the try/catch here: The error would be thrown after the try/catch block completes.
```

Please look carefully at how this is done.  You will need to do it from time to time, because some functions that you will need to use only support callbacks.  The wrappering isn't very hard.  Every time you do the wrapper, it looks just the same.  You do need the try/catch once you wrapper the function.  Of course, the advantage is that subsequent file operations, also wrappered the same way, could be added without having to create a nested series of callbacks.  Be careful when you create such a wrapper.  The callback inside your wrapper must always call resolve() or reject(), or your process hangs.

Fortunately, most Node functions do support promises.  There are promise based versions of all the file system functions.  So, you can do:

```js
import fs from "fs/promises"; // get the promise enabled version of the API

const doFileOperations = async () => { // you can't use await in mainline code, so you need this
  try {
    const fileHandle = await fs.open("./tmp/file.txt", "w");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("A error occurred.", err);
  }
};

doFileOperations(); 
```

This is the way you'll do file I/O for the most part.  Once you have the fileHandle, you can do `fileHandle.read()`, `fileHandle.write()`, and `fileHandle.close()`, all of them async functions you call with await.

### **Streams for Large Files**

When working with large files, reading the entire file into memory at once (using `fs.readFile()` or `fs.promises.readFile()`) can be problematic. If you try to read a 1GB file, your program will attempt to load all 1GB into memory, which can cause performance issues or even crash your application if there isn't enough memory available.

**Streams** provide a solution to this problem. A stream allows you to read or write data in chunks, processing it piece by piece rather than loading everything into memory at once. Think of it like drinking from a water bottle: you can take small sips (chunks) rather than trying to gulp the entire bottle at once.

#### **Reading Files with Streams**

Node.js provides `fs.createReadStream()` to read files as streams. Here's a basic example:

```js
import fs from 'fs';

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('./largefile.txt', { encoding: 'utf8' });

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  // This callback is called for each chunk of data
  console.log('Received chunk:', chunk.length, 'characters');
  // Process the chunk here (e.g., parse, transform, or write to another file)
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading the file');
});

readStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error reading file:', err);
});
```

#### **Controlling Chunk Size with highWaterMark**

The `highWaterMark` option controls the size of each chunk. By default, it's set to 64KB (65536 bytes), but you can adjust it based on your needs:

```js
import fs from 'fs';

// Read in 1KB chunks (1024 bytes)
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('./largefile.txt', { 
  encoding: 'utf8',
  highWaterMark: 1024  // 1KB chunks
});

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log('Chunk size:', chunk.length, 'characters');
  // Log first 40 characters of each chunk as an example
  console.log('First 40 chars:', chunk.slice(0, 40));
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Finished reading large file with streams.');
});
```

**Why use different `highWaterMark` values?**
- **Smaller chunks (e.g., 1KB)**: More frequent callbacks, better for processing data incrementally, but more overhead
- **Larger chunks (e.g., 64KB or 1MB)**: Fewer callbacks, less overhead, but requires more memory per chunk

#### **Writing Files with Streams**

You can also write to files using streams:

```js
import fs from 'fs';

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('./output.txt');

// Write data in chunks
writeStream.write('First chunk of data\n');
writeStream.write('Second chunk of data\n');
writeStream.write('Third chunk of data\n');

// Always close the stream when done
writeStream.end();

writeStream.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('Finished writing to file');
});

writeStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error writing file:', err);
});
```

#### **When to Use Streams**

Use streams when:
- **Large files**: Files that are too large to fit comfortably in memory
- **Real-time processing**: When you need to process data as it arrives (e.g., processing log files line by line)
- **Network operations**: When transferring data over networks
- **Memory efficiency**: When you want to minimize memory usage

Use `fs.readFile()` or `fs.promises.readFile()` when:
- **Small files**: Files that are known to be small (e.g., configuration files, small data files)
- **Simple operations**: When you need the entire file content at once
- **Convenience**: When the simplicity of reading the whole file outweighs memory concerns

Streams are a powerful feature of Node.js that enable efficient handling of large amounts of data. As you progress in the course, you'll see streams used in many contexts, including HTTP requests/responses, database operations, and file processing.

### **util.promisify()**

In the `util` package, which is part of the node base, there is a slick way to wrapper functions that use callbacks to convert it to a function that returns a promise.  Many functions have a signature like:

```js
function fnWithCallback(arg1, arg2, arg3, callback) {

}
```

The first arguments may be required or optional, but in many cases, the callback argument is required. You have to pass a function as the parameter for that argument. In some cases, the callback has one argument, the error, which is null if no error occurred. In other cases, the callback has two arguments, where the second is the returned value.  You can convert this callback-style function to return a Promise instead:

```js
import { promisify } from "util";
const fnWithPromise = promisify(fnWithCallback);
```

From an async function, you can now use `async/await`.  If the original function returns an error in the callback, the wrapper does calls `reject(err)` on the promise, which you can catch by calling `fnWithPromise` in a try/catch block.
```js
async function doSomething() {
    try {
        const result = await fnWithPromise(arg1, arg2, arg3);
        // ...
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}
```


The promisify function doesn't work in all cases. For example, `setTimeout(callback, interval)` doesn't have the right function signature for promisify because the callback function does not have enough parameters and is not last in the argument list.

## **1.8 More on Async Functions**

The flow of control in async functions has certain traps for the unwary, so it is wise to understand it fully.  In your `node-homework/assignment1` folder are two programs called `callsync.js` and `callsync2.js`.  Here is the first of these:

```js
function syncFunc() {
    console.log("In syncFunc.  No async operations here.")
    return "Returned from syncFunc."
}

async function asyncCaller() {
    console.log("About to wait.")
    const res = await syncFunc()
    console.log(res)
    return "asyncCaller complete."
}

console.log("Calling asyncCaller.")
const r = asyncCaller()
console.log(`Got back a value from asyncCaller of type ${typeof r}`)
if (typeof r == "object") {
    console.log(`That object is of class ${r.constructor.name}`)
}
r.then(resolvesTo => {
    console.log("The promise resolves to: ", resolvesTo)
})
console.log("Finished.")
```

See if you can guess which order the statements will appear in the log.  Then run the program.  Were you right?

The asyncCaller() method calls syncFunc(), which is a synchronous function, with an await.  This is valid, and the await statement returns the value that syncFunc() returns.  But asyncCaller() is an async function, so it returns to the mainline code at the time of the first await statement, and what it returns is a promise.  Processing continues in asyncCaller only after the `Finished` statement appears, because that is the point at which the event loop gets a chance to return from await.  The subsequent `return` statement in asyncCaller is different from a `return` in a synchronous function.  A return statement in an async function does something extra: It resolves the promise returned by the async function to a value.  

There are two ways to get the value a promise resolves to, those being, `await` and `.then`.  We can't do `await` in mainline code, so we use `.then` in this case.  The `.then` statement provides a callback that retrieves the value.  But the mainline code doesn't wait for the `.then` callback to complete.  Instead it announces `Finished.`, and only when the callback completes do we see what the promise resolves to.  In general, you don't want to use `.then` in your code because `.then` requires a callback, and that takes you straight back to callback hell.

The other program, `callsync2.js`, is slightly different, and if you run it, you see that the order the logged statements appear in is slightly different.  The only functional change is that asyncCaller() does not do an await when it calls syncFunc(), so it runs all the way to the end of the function before the mainline code resumes.  But what asyncCaller returns is still a promise, and the `.then` for that promise still doesn't complete until after the mainline code reports the `Finished.`  Run this program to see the difference.  Async functions always return a promise.  You can use the `await` statement to call a synchronous function, or to resolve a promise, or to resolve a `thenable` (which is an object that works like a promise but may have additional capabilities).

### **Check for Understanding**

1. What advantages does Node have over other server side languages?

2. What are three things you can do in Node that you can't do in browser side JavaScript?

3. What would you not want to do in Node?

4. What are the two ways to obtain the value resolved from a Promise?

5. What are the principal syntactic differences between Node JavaScript and browser side JavaScript?

### **Answers**

1. Node is far simpler to learn than Java or Rust.  Many developers already know JavaScript because it is the native language for the browser front end.  C++ code is also more complex, and it is subject to dangerous memory reference errors.  Node benefits from being a single-threaded language with an event loop for asynchronous operations that is highly performant.

2. In browser side JavaScript, you can't start a process, or start a server socket, or access the file system.  In browser side JavaScript, you have no access to hardware resources like the screen and the file system.

3. Node is not good for compute-intensive operations.  Instead, languages like C++ or Rust provide users more control over their program's memory management to maximize performance. JavaScript also may not be suitable for some use cases (ex: data analysis or machine learning, where Python is preferred for powerful libraries like NumPy and Pandas).

4. You can get the value resolved from a Promise using `await` or `.then`.

5. Modern Node programs use the ESM standard, which uses `import` and `export` statements.
